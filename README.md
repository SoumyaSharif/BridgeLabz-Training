# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) – Practice Branch

This branch is dedicated to day-wise practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms in Java**.  
All DSA-related implementations are maintained separately for better organization and clarity.

---

## 🌿 Branch Creation

The `dsa-practice` branch was created to isolate DSA work from other learning modules.

### Commands Used
git checkout -b dsa-practice

git push origin dsa-practice
